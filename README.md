# react-to-discourse

## Usage

```bash
$ npx create-rtd-app
```

This will prompt you for necessary information and create a new folder in your current directory.

Or if you're developing with a clone of this repository, you can run `npm link` to install it locally and then `create-rtd-app`.

The scaffolded directory should have its own `README.md`, refer to that file for development instructions.
